# The Doggy Dudes

The Doggy Dudes is a business based in Deerfield, IL.  This web application is designed to provide customers with information on the company's services.  Customers can also sign in to make appointments for the company's services, and set up monthly subscriptions.

# Motivation

Last year, my brother started a company that provides a pick-up service for people's dogs and brings them to a private park to play.  In January of 2018, I decided to become a private investor in his business by providing funding as well as my services to his business.  While we had a website that was functional, it had very little functionality for visitors.  This updated website is meant to help integrate our customers with the services we provide.
